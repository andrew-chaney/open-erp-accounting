# open-erp-accounting

The idea for OpenERP is for it to be an open-source Enterprise Resource Planning application comprised of microservices
that build out each field of functionality. This is the accounting microservice.

This is also a sandbox for me to try out other frameworks and languages when building out the individual services.
